A simple utility to convert a FreeMind mind-map (.mm) file into an S5 (html) presentation.  The root node becomes the start page and each top level node below that becomes a slide. Lower level nodes are increasingly nested lists.  Images are also supported.

You can see an example presentation [here](http://www.forusers.com/static/html/sample.html) and a picture of what it looks like in FreeMind [here](http://www.forusers.com/static/html/sample-freemind.png).

Requirements:

  * Python 2.5 or above.
